## Cisco Packet Tracer: WAN Network Simulation
# Overview
This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) file that simulates a Wide Area Network (WAN) topology. The project demonstrates core networking concepts, including routing, switching, and end-device connectivity across multiple local area networks (LANs) connected via a central router. The network is designed for educational and demonstration purposes.

# Features
WAN Topology: A hierarchical network structure with a central router connecting two separate LANs.

Routing Protocols: The network is configured with a specific routing protocol to ensure communication between all devices.

Device Configuration: Pre-configured routers, switches, and end devices.

Simulation Mode: The .pkt file is set up to be viewed and tested in Cisco Packet Tracer's simulation mode.

# Installation
To view and interact with this project, you need to have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system.

# Prerequisites
A Cisco Networking Academy account.

Cisco Packet Tracer installed. You can download it for free from the Cisco Networking Academy website.

# Steps
Clone the Repository: Use git to clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/HarikaMurali/Computer-Network

Download Cisco Packet Tracer: If you don't have it, go to the Cisco Networking Academy website, enroll in a free course like "Introduction to Packet Tracer," and download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Install Packet Tracer: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. You will be required to log in with your Networking Academy credentials to use the software.

# Setup and Usage
Once you have cloned the repository and installed Packet Tracer, follow these steps to open and explore the network.

Open the Project File: Navigate to the cloned repository folder on your computer and double-click the WAN_Network.pkt file. This will automatically open the project in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Explore the Topology: The network diagram will be visible in the Logical view.

# Run the Simulation:

Switch to Simulation mode by clicking the "Simulation" tab in the bottom-right corner of the application window.

Use the Simple PDU tool (the open envelope icon) to send a packet from one PC to another (e.g., from PC0 to PC10).

Click the Auto Capture / Play button to watch the packet travel through the network and observe the routing process.

The Event List window at the bottom will show the step-by-step progress of the packet, indicating successful or failed deliveries.
